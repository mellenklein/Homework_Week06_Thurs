## Build a To Do List App With Backbone.js

## Description

Create an app that lets you manage a list of Tasks. Each Task can (but not required to) have:

1. description (string)
2. isUrgent (boolean)
3. isDone (boolean)
4. dueDate (Date)

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Understand the difference between creating your own Backbone constructors and Backbone instances
* Understand and be comfortable using:
    - `Backbone.*.extend(...)`
    - The `Backbone.Events` mixin/prototype
    - `Backbone.View`, `Backbone.Model`, `Backbone.Collection`, `Backbone.Router`
* Understand what `this` refers to inside of the methods you extend from a Backbone Constructor
* Understand manipulating and using Backbone Models and their events
* Understand manipulating and using Backbone Collections and their events

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* Use Backbone.View's `events`,`tagName`,`className`,`initalize`,`render` properties.
* Attach a Backbone.View's `el` to the DOM
* Render out a View and it's connected data (from a Model or Collection) with an external template (such as with `Backbone.TemplateView`)
* Create any object with `_.extend({}, Backbone.Events)` and hook it up to a Backbone application/View/etc through the use of the `Events` methods.
* Backbone.Model's
    - getters/setters
    - validation
    - built-in events
* Backbone.Collection's
    - get/set/add/create/filter/map/reduce/reset
    - sorting
    - built-in events
* Backbone.Router

## Details

### Deliverables

* A publicly visible website (gh-pages, divshot, or heroku)

### Requirements

* No JSHint warnings or errors
* All specifications met below

## Easy Mode

Create an app that has a form for entering Task descriptions and adds them to a Todo List below (described above).

- Some of the informaton can be optional
- The app should re-render automatically (by use of the Backbone events)
- You should wireframe and design a basic layout before starting this app.
- Your app should use HTML/SCSS extensively for styling.
- You should use a Backbone.Router to handle routes for a home screen.
- You should have one Backbone.View sub-classes: a HomeView constructor.
- You should have a Contact Model constructor and Collection that uses the Task model
